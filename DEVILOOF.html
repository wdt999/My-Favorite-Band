                <p><br>&nbspDeviloof is a Japanese visual kei deathcore band formed in 2015.</p>
                <p>
                    &nbspDeviloof was formed on December 12, 2015, by vocalist Keisuke, bassist Daiki and drummer Hiroto who were former members of another group called All Must Die. 
                    The band has a visual style sometimes described as "flashy and super aggressive", in which they call themselves "the most violent and extreme band in Visual Kei". 
                    In August 2016 the group participated in Wacken Open Air, the world's largest metal festival, and in "Metal Battle Japan" where they advanced to the final round.
                    On October 2, 2016 guitarist Ryuya left the ban and eventually formed the band Dimlim in April 2017. 
                    The band went on a hiatus on April 30, 2017 but made a comeback on September 16, 2017.
                    On August 31, 2018, the band announced that guitarist Seiya and drummer Hiroto would be departing from the group, but the band said they would continue activities. 
                    Eventually in 2018 Aisaku and Kanta would join the band. 
                    In December 2022, Deviloof announced that they were signing with a major label, Tokuma.
                    &nbspTheir first release in the label was the Damned EP released on April 19, 2023. Speaking about the EP in a video, Keisuke said that the band was preparing a world tour for 2023.
                    In July it was announced that they will play three shows in Latin America in 2024: on May 25th in Mexico, on the 31st in Santiago and on June 2nd in Brazil.
